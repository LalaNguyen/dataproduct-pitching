## Objectives

1. Demonstrate the ability of using basic shiny app
2. Slide 1: reactive output display with isolate. GGplot2 is used. Temperature on Monthly basis is recorded.
3. Slide 2: rCharts integration for Wind Measurement on regular daily basis
4. Data Source Interaction - airquality.

Warning: For some reasons, the app occasionally fails to get resource from shiny server. Please evaluate my apps locally.
